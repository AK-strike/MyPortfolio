    <h2>What Is a Portfolio Website?
        </h2>
        <p>Simply said, your portfolio website is a portal to showcase the online portfolio we were mentioning above to the world. It’s the vehicle that lets your individual work be shared on a public platform. A portfolio website is a unique way to tell your own story, give potential clients basic information on who you are, allow you to showcase your work, and gives them a way to contact you. Online portfolios are for everyone from photographers to artists, designers, illustrators, models, architects, videographers, music makers, and students to have a space to share what they create. They are built to showcase a wide range of art and should be catered to your style, personality, and goals.</p>
        <h2>Get Started</h2>
<p>You don’t need to be a professional website builder to build a professional website. To get started with your portfolio website, you are going to need to have the following:</p>
<h3>Web design </h3>
<p>This is the part where we talk about the actual design of your website. The foundation that holds up your structure. Choosing a template is the place where you need to start, we’ll get to that later on.</p>
<h3>What Should a Portfolio Include?</h3>
<p>Before you dive into developing your online portfolio, it’s important to take some time to decide what the purpose of your portfolio site is. Will you be using it as an online resume because you are looking to get hired? Do you want to use the site to get new clients for your own personal business? Once you decipher your ultimate goal, it will be easier to design the site that will help you reach it. Your portfolio website needs to catch visitor’s attention and give people coming to your site a good user experience. To do that, you should be sure to include the following pages: examples of your work, an about page, case studies, testimonials, a blog, and a contact page. Here is a breakdown of the content you’ll need:</p>
<h3>Your Work</h3>
<p>This one is a bit of a gimme – but, of course, your work needs to be showcased on your site! Be selective and choose the specific items that you really want people to see. Try to put yourself in the shoes of clients who will be visiting your website and think about what you would want them to see first, while also taking into consideration they may only see 1-2 things. You want to be selective with the content that you choose to share on your site, so put some thought into your best pieces and think about giving a variety that shows your ability in a number of different areas. In this section, it’s a good idea to put a logo somewhere on your work so it can’t be picked up by someone unauthorized. Using your logo can help with the security of your entities.</p>
<p>You can showcase your work in a number of different ways – you can choose to use a video presentation, have an automatic slide show, put together a thumbnail gallery, etc. You should also make sure to give your work its own page on your website. Your work is one of the most important parts of putting together your portfolio online, so really use it to show off your talent.</p>
<h3>About Page</h3>
<p>This is the section where you let your audience know a little bit more about you – the person behind the portfolio. In this part of your website, you can let clients know who you are, what your passions are, and explain some of your background. Tell them a story. It’s also a place where you can let potential employers or freelancers know about the purpose of your website – of the work or projects you are looking to take on and the purpose of your online portfolio. It’s an opportunity to share the services you can offer. Make sure to add a headshot and your name. You can also link them to other places where they can find out more information about you. For example, you might want to drive them to your LinkedIn account where they can see more about your skills or any references you have on there. This part of your site is about you, so show them who you are. Use your spark or humour or charm! Make sure your about page gives a person visiting your site a glimpse at who you are and has your personal flare on display.</p>
<h2>How Many Pages Should Your Portfolio Be?</h2>
<p>Your portfolio should show a wide range of skills and abilities through the largest variety of work you can share. It is suggested that you fill about 20-30 pages of online space on your portfolio site. Showing a healthy breadth of different content options will go the furthest. A potential client will want to see the different services you can deliver or projects you have worked on. It’s still important to be creative and selective in ensuring that you are presenting your best work. The design of your portfolio site should be that you can hold enough pages of your quality content. This means you don’t want your site to be too laggy because you have lots of pages, so be sure your site is good enough to handle it. Quality over quantity is always something that you should keep in mind as you decide the pieces you are going to highlight in your online portfolio.</p>
<h2>How Do I Make a Portfolio?</h2>
<p>And now that you have all the information you need to create an online portfolio website, it’s time to get moving. Your portfolio website needs to be easy to navigate and user-friendly, but it also should be easy to maintain for your own sake. If you aren’t a web designer, then make sure to set yourself up in a way you can easily maintain long-term. Start by choosing a format for your portfolio using Format that best suits the style and themes you are looking to portray. You are going to want to put some thought into what you want your domain name to be, the plug-ins you want to host on your website. The development stage putting together the website can be time-consuming, but once the structure is set up it becomes easy to maintain and update as you go. Don’t be shy to ask designers for tips if you run into any problems as you are building the site, because websites can be tricky. The best part is, once it’s all set up you’ll have a beautifully polished portfolio to share with the world.</p>
<p>We are excited to see the online portfolio you develop! The world is yours.</p>
